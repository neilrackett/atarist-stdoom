# DOOM Accelerator

Microfirmware for the [SidecarTridge Multi-device](https://sidecartridge.com)
by [Neil Rackett](https://x.com/neilrackett)

## Introduction

At the heart of your SidecarTridge Multi-device is an RP2040 processor with the same raw power as a 386DX or 486SX CPU.

The DOOM Accelerator microfirmware is designed to harness that power into a coprocessor that can make DOOM truly playable on a stock Atari ST.

The ST host side lives in [`../linuxdoom-1.10`](../linuxdoom-1.10) (`sidecart_md.c/.h`, `sidecart_stubs.S`);
this directory is the RP2040 firmware.

## Installation

1. Download the latest files from the [releases page](https://github.com/neilrackett/atarist-stdoom/releases).
2. Copy the `.uf2` and `.json` files to the `/apps` folder of your SidecarT's microSD card.
3. On the Booster screen, press ESC for the app list and select the DOOM Accelerator app.
4. To return to Booster, turn on your ST while holding the SELECT button on your SidecarT.

You'll know if the microfirmware is working because you'll see "DOOM Accelerator ready" on your ST's screen as it boots.

## Status

- **Milestone 1 (done):** PING detection. The firmware publishes a ready magic,
  answers `CMD_STDOOM_PING` with a version string, and echoes the protocol
  token. STDOOM reports "accelerator detected" at startup.
- **Milestone 2 (done):** C2P (chunky-to-planar) offload. STDOOM uploads the
  chunky framebuffer, the RP2040 converts it to planar slot 0, and the ST blits
  it to screen. Gameplay frames render through the accelerator end-to-end on a
  Mega STE at 16 MHz + cache, with correct geometry. `sidecart/tests/C2PTEST.TOS`
  remains the preferred standalone hardware validation target.
- **Milestone 3 (done):** full C2P replacement. _All_ rendering (splash, menus,
  intermission, automap, status bar, gameplay) goes through the accelerator when
  present, with dirty-rect support (only changed status-bar cells / the active
  zoomed-view rectangle are updated). The sidecart path now lives in a separate
  `sidecart_c2p.c` that overrides the pure-software `atari_c2p.c`. Confirmed on a
  Mega STE at 16 MHz + cache. `sidecart/tests/RECTTEST.TOS` validates the
  dirty-rect pipeline standalone.
- **Milestone 4 (next):** dynamic 16-colour palette (median cut / greyscale) and
  selectable dither modes (none, greyscale, 2×2/4×4 Bayer).
- **Milestone 5:** async data processing — non-blocking C2P dispatch; the ST
  fires C2P and returns to game logic immediately, synchronising only at vsync
  before the planar copy. No extra memory; `sidecart_stubs.S` unchanged.

Longer term, this accelerator design is intended as the model for a new (clean)
Atari ST SDL XBIOS driver.

## Building

The firmware builds against the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK + Pico Extras, registered
as git submodules of the `atarist-stdoom` repo at `sidecart/pico-sdk` and
`sidecart/pico-extras`.

From the repo root:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive sidecart/pico-sdk sidecart/pico-extras
```

(`rp/build.sh` also runs this automatically and pins the SDK tags.)

You also need:

- the ARM cross-toolchain, CMake, and picotool on your PATH.
- [`atarist-toolkit-docker`](https://github.com/sidecartridge/atarist-toolkit-docker) to compile the ST host side.

## Build

In this folder, run:

```sh
make build        # release build
make build debug  # debug build and test apps
```

Flash the resulting `.uf2` to the SidecarT or copy both the `.uf2` (with the version
number removed) and `.json` to the `apps` folder on your SidecarT's SD card.

## Layout

```
rp/src/                RP2040 firmware
  stdoom_commands.h    command IDs + shared ROM-in-RAM memory map
  stdoom_protocol.c    cartridge-bus protocol DMA bridge
  stdoom_worker.c      command dispatch (PING/INIT/SET_MAP/BLIT_ROWS/C2P) + token handshake
  emul.c               bootstrap (ROM emulation + worker loop)
target/atarist/src/    m68k cartridge stub (main.s) → target_firmware.h
desc/app.json          SidecarT app manifest
```
